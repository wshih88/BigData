# Amazon Product Reviews Analysis
Peer reviews have been a longstanding method to bring legitimacy to an observation and skepticism is the heart of the scientific method. Amazon applying customer reviews to products on their marketplace, with good intentions could be very insightful.

Looking at hardcopy video game reviews, we see a significant difference in reviews by non-Vine reviewers and Vine reviewers (1,718,706 to 4291 reviews, respectively). Surprisingly, despite the overwhelming difference in counts, the average star ratings were about the same (4.06 Stars non-Vine reviews, 4.07 Stars Vine reviews).

Shoppers also found Vine reviews to be slightly more helpful with an average vote of 2.35 per product while non-Vine reviews averaged 2.26 votes.

Non-Vine reviewers gave out more five star ratings than Vine reviewers (57.55% to 37.45% respectively). With the average overall star ratings being very close, we can assume that the general rating distribution for non-Vine reviewers to be skewed to the left, while Vine reviewers are less skewed to the left and closer to a normal distribution in comparison. This leads us to believe that the skewed reviews of non-Vine reviewers may have a higher probability of a false positive for a good product, potentially leading consumers with false hope and buyers remorse.

Perhaps in an attempt to mitigate online trolls and fake reviews, the Vine program while incentivized seems to have a more robust outcome, and their reviews seem to be more trustworthy than those of the general populace. Further analyses are recommended, such as conducting a two-sample t-test for the helpful votes and visualizing the distribution of scores.
